							<p><br><br>Hi, I'm Yaseen Maqsudi. I'm currently studying computer science and applied math at Stony Brook University. </p>
							<p>I've had a passion for computers for as long as I can remember -- growing up I was fortunate enough to become exposed to coding at 8 years old, and my interest hasn't slowed down since. I've worked on personal websites, corporate websites, online games, desktop games, scripts, and robots. I love to learn and I love to pass on my knowledge to others.</p>

							<p>I have experience tutoring kids in math and coding, and I enjoy teaching concepts just as much as learning new ones! Because I've been coding since a young age, I beleive I not only have a lot of experience and knowledge in core computer science concepts, but I also have the ability to explain these ideas in a way that made sense to an 8 year old me.</p>
